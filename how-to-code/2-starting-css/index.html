		<h1>Starting CSS</h1>

		<p></p>
		<a href="/how-to-code/">Back</a>

		<p>
			Now that you've learned a bit of HTML, it's time to start learning CSS.
			Remember that CSS means Cascading Style Sheets,
			so it's pretty easy to remember what it's for &ndash; style!
		</p>

		<p>
			I am continuing with the code from the previous section,
			so check that out if you haven't.
		</p>

		<p>In the CSS section, put:</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="language-css">
				* {
				  font: 200% sans-serif;
				}
			</code>
		</pre>
		
		<p>
			Press run to re-render it.
			This is actually very simple.
			The `*` means that it should affect everything.
			In the curly braces is where all of the style for the thing goes.
			We have indented a bit to show that this is a new part of nested code,
			which is for global styles.
			Each of the styles in css must have a semicolon after it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Right here, we only have the <code>font</code> style.
			This will change your font to <code>200%</code> its normal size,
			and make the font <code>sans-serif</code>.
			Basically, serif means that the font has lot's of decoration and detail, etc.,
			and sans-serif is more simple and clean.
			You can also create more specific fonts to get a better look,
			but we'll just do this for now.
			This CSS is pretty simple, so let's add some more! ;)
		</p>

		<pre>
			<code class="language-css">
				h1 {
				  font-size: 100px;
				}
				
				p {
				  font-size: 10px;
				}
			</code>
		</pre>

		<p>
			Press run, and you can see that this has a very exaggerated effect.
			The heading should be very big, and the paragraph should be very small.
			You've likely noticed that this is a bit different.
			The <code>h1</code> means that we are selecting all <code>&lt;h1></code> elements on the page.
			We are changing the font size to <b>100</b> pixels!
			Then, we are doing the same thing with the <code>&lt;p></code> element,
			and converting its font size to 10 pixels.
			The actual font sizes will be 200 pixels and 20 pixels,
			because of the other CSS that changes everything to be 200% bigger.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Go to <a href="../3-more-elements">my next article</a> to learn about some more HTML elements.
			As said in the previous article,
			check out <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a>!
			Even at my level, I still need to always come back to have a look at how to do something.
